How can we get provider for a lab_account?

The 3 Tables (LAB_ACCOUNT_LOCATION, LOCATION_PROVIDER, PROVIDER) must be joined 
for this output to work. 


SELECT 
    LAB_ACCOUNT_LOCATION.LAB_ACCT_KEY, p . *
FROM
    LAB_ACCOUNT_LOCATION 
        INNER JOIN
    LOCATION_PROVIDER lp ON lp.loc_key = LAB_ACCOUNT_LOCATION.LOC_KEY 
        INNER JOIN
    PROVIDER p ON p.prov_key = lp.prov_key 
WHERE
    LAB_ACCT_KEY = 20;
